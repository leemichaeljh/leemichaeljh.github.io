Hello! My name is Michael and I grew up in Singapore. I am now a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. Here is my [CV](files/cv.pdf) and a collection of some expository writing.

[Subquadratic Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg Epsilon Regularity Theorem](files/subquadratic-ckn.pdf)  
(with Professor Jincheng Yang)  
This note presents an existing regularity criterion for suitable weak solutions of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The original proof and its ideas are attributed to the 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0607114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work</a>
of Gustafson, Kang, Tsai. We formulate it in terms of a direct modification of the following
